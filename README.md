I created this Lead Tracker Chrome Extension while working on the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. As I worked on this project I worked with Javascript: const variables, onclick, event listeners, arrays, for loops, innerHTML, createElement, append, template strings, storing arrays, function parameters, local storage, JSON.stringify, JSON.parse, and a manifest json file.
